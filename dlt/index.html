<p>Mzamomtsha primary school in drift sand, which is a developed informal Settlement situated between Khayelitsha and umfuleni township. The school is run
by Mr. simphiwe khuze who joined in 2007 as a principal Due to the huge amount of population growth the school is now accepting pupils from grade 1 to
grade 12 The issues they are experiencing is that there is insufficient staff and classrooms
to go with the huge amounts of learners This will impact the school negatively and will make things difficult for the staff to teach the amount of learners,
including the workspace/classrooms. Mzamomtsha primary school is absently online. We will have to develop a website that will showcase the local and national footprint.</p>
