<h3>Welcome Back!!<h3>

<p>Mr Khuse and Staff wish to welcome our learners back to Mzamomtsha Primary School and wish them a very successful 2020!</p>

<h3>Prize Giving</h3>

<p>The last prize giving ceremony of our school was held on 1st January this year on the school compound.<br>
For this occasion,we were busy for about a week in decorating the school building and premises. <br>
All the buildings in our school were painted white and the premises were decorated with balloons and coloured papers.<br>
Special guests and the guardians of students were invited to this occasion. A big pandal was made for it.</br></p>

<h3>Sports Events</h3>

<p>At Mzamomtsha High, we take part in a lot of sporting events.<br>We strongly believe that physical education is an important area<br>
of the curriculum and makes a significant contribution to a child’s personal, <br>
social and moral development.<br>Therefore, our children take part in year group challenges, inter-school competitions,
<br> and many more</p>

<h3>Matric Results</h3>

<p>We were delighted to find out earlier this year that Mzamomtsha Primary School matric results were ranked 8 out of all
    high schools in the Western Cape. To put that into perspective, there are over 1600 schools in the Western Cape! We
    are very proud of our learners, and their 100% pass rate.</p>

<h3>Mr/Mrs Mzamomtsha High</h3>

<p>Mr and Miss Mzamomtsha High is a prestious annual event. Participants in the junior and senior categories are nominated by their peers.<br>
Each debutant is  expected to collect funds which are donated to the community. After the first selection round, five girls and five boys (juniors)<br>
